Notes on adaptation (how to personalize the project)

- Replace generic variable names and comments with specific choices you made (e.g., why ngram_range=(1,2), why max_features=20000).
- Add a short section "My contributions" listing what you actually did (data cleaning, modeling, deployment).
- Include short screenshots of evaluation output or a 1-min demo video you recorded with your voice explaining the tradeoffs — this signals authenticity.
- If you fine-tune the transformer, mention hyperparameters you tried and why you changed them.
- Write the README in first person (“I”) and include small code snippets you actually ran (logs, metrics).
- Cite this repository as “sample/template used for learning” if you adapted large parts.
